# Article-Search-Engine

In part 1 of this project, I searched a list of article titles to see if they contain a user provided keyword as a part of the title. In part 3, I preprocessed the metadata into dictionaries, then searched through a 2D list of article metadata in order to find articles that are relevant to our keyword.
